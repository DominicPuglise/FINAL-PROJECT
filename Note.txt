I am unable to  reconnect the RC car to my local network as of 12/13/24 (despite working previously).
Short of reflashing the OS and reuploading the python script with dependencies, I am not able to get it to work again due to these network issues. 

The provided video demonstrates most of the functionality, though with a somewhat more jittery servo motion.
